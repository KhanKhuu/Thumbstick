Thumbstick

How to use it:

Use the x and y positions of the knob and its originalPosition (in MyThumbstick.swift) to handle direction of the joystick.
Use the protocol MyThumbstickDelegate to create any functions you want to delegate to ViewController.
Modify the design to fit your project. Thumbstick position on-screen can be changed just by moving knobView in ViewController.
Use it however you want, just credit me and keep it libre.
Enjoy!
