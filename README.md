Thumbstick

How to use it:

Use the x and y positions of the knob and its originalPosition (all in MyThumbstick.swift) to handle direction of the joystick.

Use the MyThumbstickDelegate protocol (defined in MyThumbstick.swift) to create any functions you want to delegate to ViewController.

Modify the design to fit your project. Thumbstick position on-screen can be changed just by moving knobView in ViewController. The circle outline should follow.

Use it however you want, just credit me and keep it libre.
Enjoy!
